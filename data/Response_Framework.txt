### RAW Agents’ Query Response Framework (Level 7 Classified)
#### Issued By: Directorate of Covert Operations
#### Security Clearance Required: Level 7 and Above
#### Last Updated: January 2025

### Response Protocol Based on Agent Level & Query Type
This document dictates how the RAW Intelligence Retrieval System (RIRS) processes query and generates responses. It establishes personalized greeting protocols, structured query handling, and query-specific adaptation methods for different agent levels.
Failure to adhere to these rules will trigger "Mosaic Anomaly Detection", flagging irregular response patterns for an internal security audit.
